<p>
  I've been a product developer for 10 years, specializing in Ember.js, but also ready to work in JavaScript, Python, Rails, Django, and R.

<p>
  I have lived in San Francisco for 10 years and enjoy sewing, hiking, reading, traveling, dressing in costumes, and enjoying the delicious food wherever we are.
